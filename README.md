# The Inventorsâ€™ Center

This was a project borne of a desire to socialize more with the participants at The Inventor Center in Kingsport, TN. To that end I created a [Discord](https://discord.gg) server. Discord server invites include reasonably long random strings, so to have something more easily rememberable *(& w/o access to the DNS for `theinventorcenter.org`)* I put it at [chat.inventors.center](https://chat.inventors.center).

The domain `inventor.center` was already claimed & I've never understood why the name isn't plural possessive anyway, so for these few documents [the organization](https://inventors.center) is the property of a group of inventors. ðŸ˜¼
