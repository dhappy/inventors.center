We are here to learn, share, and make. We want everyone to feel comfortable asking questions, trying new things, and making mistakes. We ask that your conduct is guided by the desire to help us create an inclusive, encouraging, and diverse environment free of intimidation and harassment. We are an eighteen and over facility.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Comments, actions, or visual displays which demean, harass, or insult others are not permitted.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">This includes those which target a person’s race, creed, ethnicity, age, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical appearance, or ability.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">The Inventors’ Center reserves the right to summarily eject you if you recklessly endanger others, act in violation of the code outlined  above, or otherwise behave poorly.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">If someone is abusive or causes you to feel uncomfortable, speak to a member of staff or email us at <a href="mailto:%22IC%3A%20Abuse%20Reporting%22%20%3Cabuse@inventors.center%3E">abuse@inventors.center</a>.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">This code of conduct is neither exhaustive nor complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a safe, collaborative space.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Since this is community space, it is imperative that we work together to communicate and educate others on proper shop etiquette to ensure the safety and pleasure of working in this great space. The IC reserves the right to revoke shop or tool use and require retraining if a particular member is continually damaging tools through  inappropriate use or negligence or leaving messes for others to clean up.</p></section> <section id="policies" class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h2 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Policies and Procedures</h2> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">We strive to provide a safe, productive and fun work environment for its members. In light of this mission, we ask you to obey the following policies and procedures for working in our facility.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Failure to obey these policies and procedures can make our facilities dangerous or unwelcoming to others, and such actions on your part may result in your license being terminated without notice. Please take them seriously. We reserve the right to change these policies and procedures as needed and with sufficient notice to members.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Individual Safety: Obey all posted signs and literature pertaining to the safe use of our facilities.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">These include but are not limited to signs regarding appropriate shop clothing and protective gear, techniques for safe equipment use, material-specific precautions for equipment, and machine tool lockouts. Do not use equipment you are not comfortable with or trained to use. Our strong preference is that you not operate heavy machinery after staffed hours without a partner in the facility; operate it individually at your own risk. Default to asking for help if uncertain.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Shared Safety: In a shared and open facility like ours, it is possible for less experienced members to operate equipment dangerously without knowing it. Please stay on the lookout for unsafe behavior, and approach and offer feedback to fellow members if you believe they are working unsafely. Please notify staff immediately if you believe any piece of equipment or infrastructure to be unsafe.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Respectful Behavior: In both in-person and electronic interactions, behave respectfully, courteously, and professionally to your fellow members. No discrimination, harassment, or hate speech shall be tolerated.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Courtesy of Open Space: Keep noise levels to a respectful minimum for the comfort and enjoyment of those in the immediate area. No overly loud music, tool use or other noise will be permitted in the open space area without the explicit permission of the members around you. No fumes or flames are permitted in unventilated areas. Restore the open space to be as clean as or cleaner than when you found them. Please respect and do not interrupt any official IC activities or classes in the open space.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Guests: Non-member guests are permitted in the IC so long as they do not use IC equipment or shared areas or interfere with other members. Guests and their actions are the sole responsibility of the host member. The member is responsible for ensuring the guest signs a liability waiver upon entering the building.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Tolerance of Feedback: Please be open to constructive feedback from fellow members, especially as it pertains to the safe use of our equipment and disrespectful communication or behavior.</p></section> <section id="payment" class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h2 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Payment and Billing Terms</h2> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Payment for membership and space are due monthly on or before your billing date.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Incoming payments may be applied to the oldest outstanding invoice if there is an outstanding balance on your account.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Late fees, in the amount of 5% of the monthly fees due, may be charged 10 days after the billing date and monthly thereafter until the outstanding balance is paid in full.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">All monthly and annual membership are recurring by default.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">By signing up as a member you are committing to a 3 month minimum membership term.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">30 days notice is required to terminate memberships. Cancellations must be submitted via Podia, or by emailing <a href="mailto:%22IC%3A%20Membership%22%20%3Cmembers@inventors.center%3E">members@inventors.center</a>. Verbal or handwritten cancellations are not accepted.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">All membership payments are final. No refunds are available.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">If a membership billing error has occurred, please notify Member Services within 60 days of the said error by emailing <a href="mailto:%22IC%3A%20Membership%22%20%3Cmembers@inventors.center%3E">members@inventors.center</a>. The Inventors’ Center will not refund membership billing errors older than 60 days.</li></ul></section> <section id="privacy" class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h2 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Privacy Policy for Members</h2> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">In order to foster a safe and supportive member atmosphere, we ask all members to abide by these privacy policies. Please also see our Privacy Policy for how the IC itself protects members’ personal data.</p> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Personal Responsibility:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">We expect our members to protect private and confidential information, especially that which affects the well-being of others. This can include pictures or names of our other members <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(some of whom go by names other than their so-called "legal" names)</q>, descriptions of their work, or the contents of their communications. The sections below expand on this philosophy.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">We also expect you abide personally by the same provisions that the IC abides by in general.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">This means that the same sort of data that we take care to protect our members should be protected by you as well.</p></section> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Photography: Still or Video:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Not everyone shares the same attitude towards having their picture online. Please ask in advance before photographing people.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Additionally, some people may be working on projects that they don't wish to get publicized early.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Please ask before photographing other members' work or before describing it in public. <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(If you have work that you absolutely don't want to be photographed while you're not around, consider covering it. Even with the best of intentions, it might otherwise wind up in the background of some unrelated shot)</q>.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">We request that permission is obtained from people before they are recorded or photographed, and if the pictures/video/audio/etc will be posted anywhere online, permission to do that should also be obtained. Please refrain from taking pictures of in-progress projects; only projects clearly on display can be photographed.</p></section></section> <section id="data" class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h2 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Data</h2> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Members may transmit data on our wireless network or leave it stored on various computers such as classroom machines or CNC machinery. We expect that members do not deliberately eavesdrop on each others' communications. We similarly expect that members will not go to unusual lengths <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(such as forensic examination of unused disk areas on shared machines)</q> to recover files deleted by other members. If a member leaves an undeleted file on a shared computer, you may look at it to figure out what it is or who to contact about it, especially if you think it might need to be saved or if it might need to be deleted to free up space, but you do not have rights to copy it for your own use; please ask first.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Do not swamp our local network. While the occasional large download is fine, routine or continuous high-rate usage can interfere with others' use. Similarly, anything that attracts the attention of law enforcement <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(such as downloading copyrighted works)</q> is not allowed. This is both a legal and a privacy issue — if we have problems with these sorts of things, we will be forced to deploy much more privacy-intrusive technologies such as individual authentication for every network connection, and much longer-lived logs of who does what which degrade everyone's privacy and cost us time and effort.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Private wireless access points in infrastructure mode <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(the usual mode)</q> must be cleared with IC before deployment. In general, there should be no reason you'd need to deploy one anyway. In particular, we need to ensure that you aren't capturing data from other users, even by accident, and we need to make sure we can turn off your AP if it is interfering with our network. Access points in client mode such as laptops are of course allowed. If you have a wired-only device, you may use an access point in client-bridge mode to get it on our network; please ask for advice <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(for starters, we will need to give your AP a static IP address)</q>, and see also the acceptable use of our public network on the following page.</p></section> <section id="net" class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h2 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Acceptable Use of our Network</h2> <p class="intro svelte-ph4gv3">Why do we have these policies? We need to make sure that we:</p> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Are legally protected</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Do not have to spend time policing members' behavior</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Can offer a usable network for the convenience of our members</li></ul> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">These guidelines are intended to keep our network functional and us out of legal trouble.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">We ask that you abide by these policies in order to allow us to achieve these goals. If you do not abide by them, your use of the network, and/or of our entire space, may be revoked. You agreed to these policies by signing your membership and/or rental agreement. We reserve the right to alter these policies at any time, and to ask you to change your network behavior if something about it is causing problems for us or any other members, even if it might seem to be strictly permitted. We are trying to make sure that everyone can communicate, and that we don't have to spend a lot of time dealing with it.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">If you have any questions about how to be a good neighbor, or you'd like advice on how to put your particular device on the network, please ask us. We're here to help.</p> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">General Considerations</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">You are expected to honor our privacy policy, which includes not intercepting communications not intended for you, not disrupting others' communications, and so forth.</p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">This also includes not trying to connect to machines for which you have no authorization. Such attempts, or use of scanning tools to discover such machines, is prohibited. If you'd like to know how the network works, please don't look like you're attacking it — just ask instead.</p></section></section> <section id="wifi" class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h2 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Wireless Network</h2> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">The network is run on a best-effort basis. This means that we will make every effort to keep it up at all times <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(the IC depends on it for its own operations as well)</q> but we cannot make any guarantees about its  availability. If you have some business need for an absolutely reliable network, you should arrange to pay someone for that service. We are not in that business.</p> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Bandwidth:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">You are expected to use reasonable shared-bandwidth behavior. This means not continuously using large amounts of the shared bandwidth. We would like to do this on the honor system and not have to enforce limits. That means:</p> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">No unattended BitTorrent. <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(If you'd like to torrent down a Debian release and then turn it off, that's okay, but don't leave it serving after you're done.)</q></li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Nothing that could cause the RIAA or MPAA to serve us papers. <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(No violation of copyrights: don't torrent a movie.)</q></li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3"><p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Nothing that could cause us to have to handle a DMCA takedown order. <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(Again, no violation of copyright: don't set up a warez site.)</q></p> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">As a rule of thumb, expect that our total available bandwidth is equivalent to a medium-quality cable-modem connection <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(because it is a cable-modem connection)</q>. But unlike your connection at home, this one is shared by dozens of people and devices.</p></li></ul></section></section> <section id="trash" class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h2 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Trash and Materials</h2> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Trash:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">In general, be considerate of yourself and your fellow members when using the trash. Here are some pro-tips:</p> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Do not overfill the trash cans so that they are not too heavy or potentially dangerous. Do not put anything sharp in bagged trash. Wrap sharp things in cardboard and tape.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Do not overfill bags; keep in mind bagged trash needs to be lifted to shoulder-height into the dumpster.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Do not put electronic waste in the trash or dumpster. Do not put hazardous waste in the trash or dumpster.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Do not put paint in the dumpster without using a hardener powder for paint disposal. It's really cheap at Home Depot.</li></ul></section> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Dumpster Location:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">The dumpster is located outside of The Inventors’ Center. To get to the dumpster, go out the garage door in the woodshop. We have a large green dumpster, and one rolling trash can.</p></section> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Bulk Trash:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">If you have a large object or objects to dispose of, please bring them directly to the city dumpster.</p></section> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Perishables <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(food)</q>:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">All food and drink should go in the trash can in the main room which has a lid! Please pour out drinks in the sink before disposing of the cup.</p></section> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Cardboard:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Please break down boxes prior to throwing them into the bin to conserve space. Cardboard is useful also for testing on the laser cutter and for spray painting – usable pieces can be kept above the planer for painting, or cut down into 1x2’ pieces for the laser.</p></section> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Wood:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Please place scrap wood at the bin next to the entrance of the wood shop. Cut it up into small manageable pieces. Exceptionally useful, true, and undamaged scrap of linear wood <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(not sheet goods)</q> can be sorted by length in wood storage. All wood will go in the dumpster. Large projects or pieces of wood fall under <q>bulk trash</q>.</p></section> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Metal:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">We have a scrap bin that is picked up periodically in the welding shop. Please make sure items are safely in the container.</p></section></section> <section id="tidy" class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h2 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Tidy Space Policy</h2> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">With almost an acre of space, everything needs to be taken care of. The overview for the need of this set of guidelines is this: a single member leaves a single item in a shared space, like an aisle or the social area. If only you left a single item out, it would be okay. If our 70+ members and visitors who visit the makerspace each week all left a single thing out, we would be buried in stuff. We have requirements to maintain egress paths from the fire department. We have accessibility requirements from the ADA. We need to maintain a good faith effort of keeping our space clean.</p> <h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Abandoned Property:</h3> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Things left around that are unlabeled are abandoned property.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">If you are leaving for more than a half hour, make sure you have labeled your project with a Project in Progress note specifying who left it, how long it will be there, and when it is safe to move if needed. Please do not leave projects in general-use space for more than 24 hours.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Small items may be found at the lost and found area. Large items may be moved to the closet near the wood shop or disposed of.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Valuables such as jewelry, keys and cell phones may sometimes be kept by in the mechanical closet.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Things that look like trash will be thrown out <q class="parens svelte-ph4gv3">(wood scraps, electronic parts, food, etc)</q>.</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Moving Other Peoples’ Work:</h3> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">All unattended projects should have a note detailing when you will return to move it, how someone else might move it safely, and special considerations i.e. "the paint will be dry by 4 pm Friday."</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">If you come across a project that is in an aisle or other shared space, look around to see whose it is. If no one is around, a note should be present. If no one around knows anything about the project and you need the resource, please be respectful if you need to move it.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Respecting other people's projects is the right thing to do. Treat them better than you would want your own project treated.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">If you can put the project in a box or container to keep things together, that is best. If you know whose project it is, try to contact them. If not, you could send an email to <a href="mailto:lost@inventors.center">lost@inventors.center</a>.</li></ul></section> <section id="delivery" class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h2 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Deliveries</h2> <h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Incoming:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">You need to either be present or make arrangements with another member to receive the delivery. Leaving things at the load-in bay is not cool. Wood deliveries can be made in the Alley behind the makerspace, metal deliveries can be made in the designated loading zone on the Shelby St. end of the makerspace.</p> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">We <span class="warn svelte-ph4gv3"></span> have a loading dock. We cannot accept dock height trucks only Lift-gate trucks.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Plan deliveries around projects. If you are bringing in 20 sticks of 2 inch tube for a project next week, have a plan to cut it up the day it comes in. Do not expect to use a cart in the aisle for storage for a week.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">If you bring things in, take it of the cart and return the cart once you get to the workshop you are in.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Take care of your shipping materials, like boxes, pallets, and foam. Pallets should be cut up. Cardboard should be broken down.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Everything else should be disposed of based on our waste policy.</li></ul> <h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Outgoing:</h3> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">We are not a daily pick-up location for any carrier.

Wearing hearing protection helps prevent both short- and long-term hearing damage due to harmful decibel levels, and also prevents debris from entering the ear.</p> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Disposable foam earplugs are a good choice for blocking sound and, when welding, for keeping sparks from traveling down the ear canal.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Earmuffs are usually the best choice for hearing protection, as they will keep all foreign objects out of the ear.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">When working in areas with very high noise, both earplugs and earmuffs can be worn to provide better protection.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Exercise caution and be aware of your surroundings when wearing hearing protection, since it will be harder to hear people talking, auditory alerts on machines, and alarms.</li></ul></section> <section class="svelte-ph4gv3"><h3 class="svelte-ph4gv3">Hand Protection:</h3> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">Gloves can prevent injuries in certain situations while increasing the likelihood of injury in others.</p> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Gloves must not be worn when using tools such as bandsaws, lathes, drill press, and grinders.</li></ul> <p class="svelte-ph4gv3">If a glove gets caught in a tool you can be pulled in and seriously injured or killed.</p> <ul class="svelte-ph4gv3"><li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Leather work gloves are ideal when handling material to protect from splinters and cuts. They often have nylon backs and should not be used for welding or handling hot metal. MIG welding gloves are made of heavy material to resist sparks and heat.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Oxy-acetylene fuel gloves are slightly lighter to resist heat while allowing for greater control of the filler wire.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">TIG gloves are the thinnest and allow finer control of the filler material. They are more sensitive to heat.</li> <li class="svelte-ph4gv3">Rubber gloves may be needed when working with chemicals.
